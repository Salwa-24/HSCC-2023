Code Guide

The datasets folder contains .csv files which are passed as input to our python code.

Python code files

I. HSCC-2023-Hirearichal_Clustering.py
This file contains Hierarchical Clustering python code, the results obtained are visualized in Fig. 6.

II. HSCC-2023-k-Means_Clustering.py
This file contains k-Means clustering python code, whose results are tabulated in Table VI. The QQ plot code within that file results in graphs as shown in Fig. 7 and the KS-Test results are tabulated in Table V.

III. Datasets 

1. HSCC-2023-rawdata.csv
This csv file conatins the rawdata collected. This dataset is then analyzed and then divided into three seperate csv files specifically used for each of the cases. The rawdata involves the captures taken while uploading 100Mb and 300Mb files to the cloud.

2. HSCC-2023-kstest.csv
This file is used within the k-Means clustering code, which results in giving Statistics and p-value tabulated in Table V. 

3. HSCC-2023-Case1.csv
This file is used for 'Control vs Minimal Scan' with and without outliers. The result of this csv file being ran is visualized in Fig. 8 and tabulated in Table VI(column 3 & 4). 

4. HSCC-2023-Case2.csv
This file is used for 'Control vs HardEnd Scan' with and without outliers. The result of this csv file being ran is visualized in Fig. 9 and tabulated in Table VI.(column 3 & 4) 

5. HSCC-2023-Case3.csv
This file is used for 'Minimal vs HardEnd Scan' with and without outliers. The result of this csv file being ran is visualized in Fig. 10 and tabulated in Table VI.(column 3 & 4)
